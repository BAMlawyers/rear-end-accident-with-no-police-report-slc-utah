##  What the Law Says

###  Utah Code ¬ß 41-6a-401  
**Duties after accident** ‚Äî You are required to stop, exchange information, and file a report *only if injuries or damages exceed $2,500*. Failure to report does not automatically destroy your claim, but it can be used by insurance companies to dispute your credibility or the severity of your injuries.

###  Utah Code ¬ß 31A-22-305.3  
**Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIM)** ‚Äî If the at-fault driver‚Äôs coverage is insufficient, your UIM policy may apply. The absence of a police report is **not a valid legal reason to deny coverage**, but adjusters will often argue lack of documentation to reduce payouts.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### ‚ùì *Can I still file a claim without a police report?*  
 Yes. You are still entitled to file a bodily injury claim under Utah law. Eyewitness statements, photos, dash cam footage, and medical records can substitute for a police report.

### ‚ùì *Will the insurance company use this against me?*  
 Likely. They may argue the accident wasn‚Äôt serious or that injuries were fabricated. This is why early legal counsel is essential.

### ‚ùì *Does it affect UIM eligibility?*  
 No. UIM cannot be denied solely because a police report was not filed. See **Utah Code ¬ß 31A-22-305.3(4)(c)(ii)** ‚Äî reductions in coverage require written agreement or statutory justification.

### ‚ùì *What if I delayed seeking treatment?*  
Delays may hurt credibility but **do not legally bar recovery**. Document symptoms and seek care as soon as possible. A rear-end mechanism of injury supports claims of whiplash or back injury, even without initial documentation.

## Legal Strategy Insights

- **Adjuster trick**: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt call the police, so we can‚Äôt confirm liability.‚Äù  
   *Response:* Liability in Utah rear-end cases is presumed. Lack of a report doesn‚Äôt erase fault.

- **If your own insurer delays or denies UIM**:  
   Demand explanation in writing. Cite **305.3** and request reconsideration or prepare for litigation.

- **Build your case with:**  
  - Photographs of property damage  
  - Mechanism of injury descriptions  
  - Medical journals or literature on delayed onset of whiplash
